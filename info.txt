Say it aloud using espeak (say didn't pipe)

sudo apt install espeak 
#v1
echo "Why is the sky blue?" | ollama run tinyllama --verbose | espeak

espeak --voices=variant

#v2
echo "Why is the sky blue?" | ollama run tinyllama --verbose | espeak -ven+f2

Read it and let me read the text

echo "Why is the sky blue?" | ollama run tinyllama --verbose | tee response.txt| espeak -ven+f2; cat response.txt
 
maybe espeak -f <text file> OR --stdin Takes the text input from stdin.

#v4 Final for now
FASTER (-s 260 default is 175) with female voice (ven+f2) and display text from saved file (response.txt)
time echo "Why is the sky blue?" | ollama run tinyllama --verbose | tee response.txt| espeak -ven+f2 -s 260; cat response.txt

time echo "Why is the sky blue?" | ollama run dolphin-phi --verbose | tee response.txt| espeak -ven+f2 -s 260; cat response.txt
# 1.6GB

Ideas? create an alias so I can just type llm Why is the sky blue?

#v4a Here is a function that must be asked with quotes. Can be added to bashrc as an alias
ollama_ask() { echo "$1" | ollama run tinyllama --verbose; }
ollama_ask "why do we have a leap year?"

#v4b Combine with v4 for read back and print out response
ollama_say() { echo "$1" | ollama run tinyllama --verbose | tee response.txt| espeak -ven+f2 -s 260; cat response.txt ; } 
ollama_say 'when does summer start?'
